This app pulls a random park in or around the St. Louis area for the visitor to visit.

The user can confirm the park which will then take the park off of the parks to be visited and add it to a list of parks visited.

Likewise the user can skip the park which will leave the park on the list of parks to be visited and generate a new randomly selected park for the user to confirm or skip. 

Once a park is confirmed, the park name is taken off of the list and added to the visited parks list.
