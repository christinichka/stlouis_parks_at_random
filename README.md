This is a passion project I created when I moved to the St. Louis area to be able to explore parks with my family.

This app pulls a random park in from a csv of parks that are located around the St. Louis area for the visitor to visit.

The user can confirm the park which will then take the park off of the parks to be visited and add it to a list of parks visited.

Likewise the user can skip the park which will leave the park on the list of parks to be visited and generate a new randomly selected park for the user to confirm or skip.
